   * @brief Steer the robot in one direction using a turn ratio between two motors.
   *  
   * A robot driving with two motors can steer itself by changing the speed of 
   * one motor compared to the speed of the other. To make a slow turn to the left, you might 
   * make the right motor run slightly faster than the left one. To make a fast, or sharp, 
   * turn to the right, the left motor could run at least twice as fast as the right one.
   * The robot steers by using a percentage value of follow for one of the motors. 
   * This means that the motor in the turn direction will rotate slower than the other. 
   * It is the follower motor and the other motor is the drive motor. The drive motor 
   * runs at a percentage of full speed set in speed. The follower motor runs at a 
   * percentage of speed of the drive motor. So, it runs at a percentage of a percentage 
   * of full speed.
   * To make the turn happen you give a turn ratio which is a percentage value of steer 
   * to the left or right. If you want to steer to the left at 30% of the of the drive motor 
   * speed, use the value of -30 for turnRatio. Left turns use negative values and right 
   * turns use positive values. A really sharp turn to the right might use a turn ratio 
   * value of 80.
   * 
   * @param turnRatio: a number that is the percentage of speed of the drive motor. 
   * The follower motor runs at this speed. A negative number steers to the left 
   * and a positive number steers to the right. This is a number between -100 and 100.
   * @param speed: a number that is the percentage of full speed. A negative 
   * value runs the motor in the reverse direction. range -100 to 100
   * @param value: the number of movement units to rotate for. A value of 0 means 
   * run the motor continuously.
   * @param unit: the movement unit of rotation. This can be milliseconds, seconds, 
   * degrees, or rotations. If the number for value is 0, this parameter isn’t used.

   * @brief Rotate two motors in synchronization.
   * 
   * Tanking the robot will drive two motors in synchronization. This means that 
   * both motors will start at the same time. Also, each motor uses the same amount 
   * of rotation when running at the same speed. You can use different speed values 
   * for each motor to perform turns or spins.

   *   attached to the left of the robot. A negative value runs the motor in the

   * @param value: the number of movement units to rotate for. A value of 0 means
